        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Beef stew is a staple of the cold weather months for me. It is savory and delicious, while also incredibly simple to make. Best served alongside freshly baked bread.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1 Tbsp.</strong> vegetable oil</li>
            <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> all-purpose flour</li>
            <li><strong>2 lb.</strong> beef stew meat, cut into 1 inch cubes</li>
            <li><strong>1</strong> medium yellow onion, peeled and chopped</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> carrots, peeled and chopped into rounds</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> stalks of celery, chopped</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
            <li><strong>3</strong> or more, cloves of garlic, pressed</li>
            <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> tomato paste</li>
            <li><strong>6 cups</strong> beef broth</li>
            <li><strong>1 cup</strong> red wine</li>
            <li><strong>1 Tbsp.</strong> Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li><strong>2 Tsp.</strong> dried thyme</li>
            <li><strong>2</strong> bay leaves</li>
            <li><strong>1 lb.</strong> Russet potatoes, peeled and chopped into 1 inch cubes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>In a medium bowl, combine flour, a pinch of salt, and a couple shakes of pepper. 
                Add beef to the bowl and toss until coated on all sides.</p></li>
            <li><p>Add oil to a large pot or dutch oven over medium heat. 
                Once oil is hot, add beef and cook for about 10 minutes, turning beef occasionally to ensure it is seared on all sides. 
                Once done, transfer beef to a plate and set aside.</p></li>
            <li><p>If needed, add more oil to the pot. 
                Add carrots, onion, and celery to the pot, stirring occasionally, for about 7 minutes or until softened. 
                Season with salt and pepper. 
                Add garlic and tomato paste and cook, stirring, until garlic is fragrant and tomato paste darkened, about 2 minutes.
                Return the beef and any accumulated juices to the pot.
                Add the beef broth, red wine, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, and bay leaves, stirring briefly to combine once all ingredients have been added.
                Bring to a boil then reduce to medium-low heat and season with salt and pepper. 
                Let it simmer, covered, for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p></li>
